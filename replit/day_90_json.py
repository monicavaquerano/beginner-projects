ðŸ‘‰ Day 90 Challenge
Today's challenge is to use the code you've just seen to pull in data for 10 users using randomuser.me again.
Your program should:
1. Save the medium quality version of the profile pic as a local file named {firstName} {lastName}.jpg.
2. Each picture should be saved to a different file.
Hints:
* Use a for loop to send 10 requests, eg: for person in user["results"]:
