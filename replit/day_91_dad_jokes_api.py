ðŸ‘‰ Day 91 Challenge
Today's challenge is to build a program from this basic principle that will:
1. Give you a random joke.
2. Ask if you want to save it.
3. If you do, it should:
    i. Save the joke ID number to a replit db
4. Ask the user if they want to see the saved jokes and output the contents of the database.

Hints:
* Check out the fetching a specific joke examples on the icanhazdadjoke API.
