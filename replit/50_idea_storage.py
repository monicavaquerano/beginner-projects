Idea Maker...
Do you have brilliant ideas at inconvenient times? Do you need a handy way of storing those ideas? Have you never heard of smartphone voice note apps? Or pens and paper? Then, today's project is for you!

Head on over to the challenge page for all the amazing details.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ‘‰ Day 50 Challenge
Day 50! Boy, you are smashing this 100 days! ðŸŽŠ To celebrate, here's a project for you.

Your idea storage system should:

1. Prompt the user to add an idea, or load a random one.
2. Choosing 'Add an idea' results in:
    i. A prompt for the user to input their idea.
    ii. Add the idea to a text file called 'my.ideas'.
    iii. Add the idea in append mode, with every new idea on a brand new line.
3. Choosing 'Load random' results in:
    i. Load the list of ideas.
    ii. Choose one at random.
    iii. Display it on screen for a few seconds.
    iv. Return to the menu.

Example:

ðŸŒŸIdea StorageðŸŒŸ
Add an idea or see a random idea? a/r. > r
Monkey tennis.
Add an idea or see a ranmdom idea? a/r. > a
Input your idea. > Youth hostelling with Chris Eubank
Nice! Your idea has been stored.

Hints:
* To pick an idea at random, you could use split() to get an array of values. Or you could use random.choice to generate a random number and keep loading lines until you get to the random number line.
* Try implementing your menu as a subroutine, so you can call it whenever you need to return to it.
