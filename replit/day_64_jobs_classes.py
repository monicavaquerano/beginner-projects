"""
ðŸ‘‰ Day 64 Challenge
In today's project, create classes to represent jobs.

Your program should

Create a generic 'job' class.
The init method will store the details for name, salary and hours worked.
'job' will have another method that prints those details nicely.
Create two sub-classes from job: 'doctor' and 'teacher'
The 'doctor' subclass should also include 'speciality' and 'years of experience'.
The 'teacher' subclass should also include 'subject' and 'position'.
The print functions for each sub-class should print this extra data.
Instantiate a lawyer, a computer science teacher, and a pediatric doctor (this is a doctor for children) with 7 years of experience.
Output the information for each job.
Example:

ðŸŒŸJobs Jobs Jobs!ðŸŒŸ
Job type: Lawyer
Salary: $ Squillions
Hours worked: 60
Job type: Teacher
Salary: $ Nowhere near enough
Hours worked: All of them
Subject: Computer Science
Position: Classroom Teacher
Job type: Doctor
Salary: $ Doing very nicely thank you
Hours worked: 50
Speciality: Pediatric Consultant
Years of Experience: 7

Hints:
* Copy the print method to each of your sub-classes and customize it for each one.
* Don't worry about keeping the same method name. The one in the sub-class will override the one in the 'job' main class.
