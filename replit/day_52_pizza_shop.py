"""
üëâ Day 52 Challenge
There's no place like Rome...Or Napoli, Milan, possibly even New York if you must.

Just not the dodgy 2am 'round bread with suspicious toppings' merchants that I definitely do not visit on my way home from a night out.

That's right, you're opening a pizza shop! Try not to get anchovy on your keyboard. Man that stuff never washes out.

Regardless, your program today must:

Prompt the user to input the quantity and size of pizzas.

Multiply the two inputs together to calculate the cost of the pizzas.

Store that in a 2D list with the user's name.

Use try.... except for two reasons:

Include auto-save and auto-load. Use it with the auto-load.
When casting the quantity of pizzas to an integer. Avoid the user crashing the program by typing 'three' instead of '3'. Or any other non-integer input. If they do, then prompt them to try again.

Example:
üåüDave's Dodgy Pizzasüåü
How many pizzas? > three
You must input a numerical character, try again. > 3
What size? > XXXXXX
Name please > David
Thanks David, your pizzas will cost XXXXX

Hints:
* Use subroutines for 'add' and 'view'
* Use a while.... true loop for the main menu
* Use a 2d list to store the details of each pizza.
* Use selection to decide which subroutine to run, then write the 2d list to the file.
* For add, get all the inputs in variables and append to a list. Append this list to a 2d one that stores all the pizza details.
* For view, get each index from one row of the 2d list at a time.
