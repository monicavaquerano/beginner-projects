Today's challenge is all about palindromes.

A palindrome is a word that is symmetrical, (i.e. it reads the same backwards as forwards).

For example:

racecar
madam
radar
Now that you know what a palindrome is, just go back and have a look at this page title. The one that made you go, huh?! Got it now? Sweet!

Hop over to the challenge page for details.

ðŸ‘‰ Day 59 Challenge
You're going to write a program that checks a string to see if it is a palindrome.

Yes. We know that Python has the built in function string.reverse() that you could use.

Zero points for that today, we want you to think hard and utilize your skills in:

* recursion
* string slicing
* looping

Your program should:

1. Prompt the user to input a word.
2. Analyze the word to see if it is a palindrome.
3. Output a relevant 'yes/no message.

Example:
ðŸŒŸPalindrome CheckerðŸŒŸ
Input a word > Racecar
Racecar is a palindrome. Yay!

Hints:
This is a tough one, so I've given you some hints about the algorithmic thinking needed for a problem like this:
* Don't forget to standardize the case on input.
* Think about which characters in a word are compared first. Check if they are the same.
* If they've been compared and are the same, remove them and repeat the process with the shorter string.
* Keep going until you're down to a string of length 1 or 0 (depending on whether the original word had an odd/even number of characters. If you get to this point, then you've got a palindrome.
