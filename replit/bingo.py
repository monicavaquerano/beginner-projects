ðŸ‘‰ Mecca Your Nan Very Happy
Today's challenge is to create a bingo card. Oh yes, because programming's not just for you hip, young cats. ðŸ˜†

Anyway, your challenge is to enable "gambling for the elderly" (aka Bingo), and you'll achieve it like this:

Randomly generate a series of number between 0 and 90.
Allocate each number to a place in a 2D list.
The numbers should be in numerical order, left to right.
Numbers should not be repeated.
The center square should not contain a number. It should contain the word 'BINGO!'.
When the program is run, the bingo card should be displayed on screen.

Hints:
Make sure you include 'prettyprinting'.
Try using a 2D list with each sublist as a row.
Randomly generate the numbers and append each to a list as you do.
Use .sort() to put the list of numbers in order before adding to the card.
